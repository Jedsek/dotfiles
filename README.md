# dotfiles

This is my dotfiles, managed by [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).
(Maybe I will use [nix/home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) or [guix/home](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Home-Configuration.html) later)  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jedsek/dotfiles.git
sudo stow --adopt dotfiles
```
